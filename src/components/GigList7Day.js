/*
Create a 7 day 'find tiny gigs' search too
Make the today vs 7-day a toggle switch

1. Edit ticketmaster.jsx to expand api call to include gigs from 7 days
2. Create second GigList component that returns list of 7 days gigs (not just today as per current GigList component)
3. I think GigSearch remains the same, but need some method to toggle the GigList components
4. GigList7Day needs to display name, venue and date as well
